🌟 One-Line Pitch

"What if your video player could automatically skip scenes you don't want to see?"
This project was born when I wished I could skip awkward scenes while watching a series. Now I'm building it with the community!
🔥 The Problem

63% of viewers want to skip:

  � Nudity/sexual content

  🔪 Graphic violence

  🤬 Excessive profanity

  😱 Jump scares (for horror)
    But no tool works across Netflix, local files, and smart TVs.
