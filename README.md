# CleanPlay

This is an idea i came up with and am not farmiliar with coding or building apps so i hope we can build a community here that can contribute and bring this idea to life for those that would love to use it in their daily lives.
It is still in the planning phase and this is my first time using github (i don't know if i have created the repo in the right way) plus i used A.I to get to this point so am welcome to any ideas on how to achieve this goal.

🌟 One-Line Pitch

"What if your video player could automatically skip scenes you don't want to see?"
This project was born when I wished I could skip awkward scenes while watching a series. Now I'm building it with the community!
🔥 The Problem

63% of viewers want to skip:

  � Nudity/sexual content

  🔪 Graphic violence

  🤬 Excessive profanity

  😱 Jump scares (for horror)
    But no tool works across Netflix, local files, and smart TVs.

🚀 Vision
